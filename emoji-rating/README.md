## Description

The Emoji Rating Component is a fun and interactive React component that allows users to rate an item using emojis. It displays a list of emojis representing different ratings, and users can click on an emoji to select their rating. The selected emoji will be visually distinguished from the others, and the corresponding numerical value of the selected rating will be displayed on the screen.

   - You can use the `selectedRating` state to achieve this effect.

5. **Challenge 5: Display the Selected Rating Value**
   - Conditionally display the selected rating value below the emoji container when a rating is selected.
   - Use the `selectedRating` state to display the numerical value of the selected emoji.
